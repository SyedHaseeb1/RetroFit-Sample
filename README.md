/**
 * Retrofit, Room, LiveData, Koin, MVVM Sample App
 *
 * This is a sample Android app that demonstrates how to use Retrofit to fetch data from an internet API,
 * save it locally using Room, and display it in a RecyclerView with an ad after every 2nd item.
 * The app also utilizes LiveData to observe changes in the data and Koin for dependency injection,
 * following MVVM architecture.
 */

// Setup
// To run the app, you will need to provide your own API key for the data source. You can obtain a free API key
// by following the instructions on the data source website. Once you have your API key, you need to add it to
// the `local.properties` file in the root of the project. Add the following line to the file with your API key:
//
// api_key="your_api_key_here"

// Libraries Used
// This project utilizes the following libraries:
// - Retrofit: for making network requests
// - Room: for local data persistence
// - LiveData: for observing data changes
// - Koin: for dependency injection
// - RecyclerView: for displaying a list of items with ads

// Architecture
// This project follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern. The app is split into three main layers:
// - Model: contains the data model classes and the repositories for fetching and storing the data.
// - View: contains the UI components, such as activities and fragments, and the adapters for displaying the data in a RecyclerView.
// - ViewModel: contains the ViewModel classes that handle the logic for the UI components and communicate with the repositories
// to fetch and store the data.

// Contributions to this project are welcome. If you would like to contribute, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
